            I lived in Vancouver for six years, where I gained valuable knowledge about property construction. I studied and learned how to build a property from the ground up. I was part of different projects both commercial and residential projects such as hospitals, shopping malls, office buildings, apartment buildinds and regular stand alone houses. The intention is to eventually develop my own projects so, if you are here for the long term, you will see me around.

                After living in Canada, I had the opportunity to apply for permanent residency, which I successfully obtained after two years. This milestone allowed me to start my own construction and renovation company, where I worked as a contractor.

               For personal reasons (I missed proper tacos, great weather, and, of course, being close to my family) I decided to move back to Mexico. While working with my brother, who has been in the real estate industry since 2013, I got certified as a real estate advisor.

                Luckily, I got the chance to do the same kind of work I was doing in the city but here in Riviera Maya, a paradise that was too tempting to resist.

                Now, in my third year in here, doing what I love, making connections that turn into great friendships. Life has been great lately, indeed.

                Not long ago, I made my first real estate investment, purchasing a piece of land in the region. Everything is going according to plan, and I'm excited about what the future holds.
