           <h1 class="title">How to buy a property as a foreigner?</h1>
           <p class="answer">
            It is very simple… and I will be there every step of the way. 

            If you are looking to acquire a property within 50 kilometeres (about 31 miles) of the coastline or 100 kilometers (about 62) of the international boarders which are considered restricted areas, you must do it through a bank trust or as we know it “fideicomiso”.
            
            This legal structure allows non-Mexican individuals or entities to indirectly own and control property in these restricted areas.
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
         <h1 class="title">How does the trust work?</h1>
         <p class="answer">
           | Creation of the trust |<br>The interested buyer (known as the beneficiary) selects a Mexican bank to act as the trustee. The buyer and the bank sign a trust agreement, which outlines the terms and conditions of the trust.</br>
           | Trustee's role |<br>The Mexican bank, as the trustee, holds legal title to the property on behalf of the beneficiary. The trustee's responsibility is to follow the instructions of the beneficiary and protect their interests.</br>
           | Beneficiary's rights |<br>Although the legal title is held by the trustee, the beneficiary maintains all the rights of ownership. They have the right to use, enjoy, lease, mortgage, sell, or transfer the property. The beneficiary can also modify or improve the property, subject to any applicable regulations.</br>
           | Trust duration |<br>The fideicomiso has a fixed term of 50 years, which can be renewed for an additional 50-year period. The beneficiary can freely transfer the trust to another eligible beneficiary during the trust's duration.</br>
           | Trustee fees |<br>The trustee charges an initial setup fee, as well as an annual fee for administrative and management services. The estimated costs of the trust are:</br>
           ˚Opening fee (permits and first annual payment):$2,000 - $2,200 USD.</br>
           ˚Annual fee: $500 - $600 USD.<br>
           | Legal protection |<br>The fideicomiso is legally recognized and protected in Mexico. The beneficiary's rights are safeguarded under Mexican law, ensuring their ownership and property rights.</br>
           | Selling the property |<br>When the beneficiary decides to sell the property, they can transfer the trust to the new buyer, who becomes the new beneficiary. This process simplifies the transaction, as the property's ownership transfers through the assignment of the trust rights, without the need for a new trust to be established.</br>

      <div class="question">
         <h1 class="title">Can I rent out my property when I am not there?</h1>
         <p class="answer">
            Yes, it is basically a hands-free business model if you hire a propery management company. There is also companies that offer a 360 service which includes the construction, the furniture and decoration and the management of your property.
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
         <h1 class="title">What is the cost of management?</h1>
         <p class="answer">
            It varies from 20% to 30% of the total revenue. However, it is generally 25%.
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
         <h1 class="title">Are there any additional costs or fees associated with purchasing the property?</h1>
         <p class="answer">
            Like anywhere else, there are closing fees which vary between 6% to 8% of the cost of the property. In the case of a pre-sale you only need the lawyers retainer to begin with the due diligence to move in with the contract. The rest is due when the property is deeded. There is also the bank trust which you can find above (Trustee fees)

      <div class="question">
         <h1 class="title">What are the property taxes for the area?</h1>
         <p class="answer">
            Unlike the US and Canada, property taxes here are minimum. I am talking about .0025% a year…

         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
         <h1 class="title">What are the financing options available for purchasing the property, and what are the mortgage rates currently?</h1>
         <p class="answer">
            Financing per se, is not common to find. However, there are a few options, the interest rates for these go from 10% to 14%. 

            What I suggest my clients that are looking for financing is getting either a personal loan or equity loan back in their country to have their rates and make a cash investment (negotiation power to make a deal) . Or considering a pre-sale which is basically “free financing” where you can give a minimum of 30% down payment and comfortably pay your unit while it is being built or leave the rest upon delivery. We can find pre-sales with more than 2 years until completion.
